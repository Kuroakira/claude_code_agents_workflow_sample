# Cutting-Edge UI Todo List - Product Scope

## MVP Scope
A beautiful, responsive single-user todo list with core CRUD operations and modern UI animations

## Core Value Proposition
Deliver a visually stunning, performant todo list application that allows users to quickly add, complete, and manage their daily tasks with delightful micro-interactions and a modern design aesthetic. The MVP validates whether users prefer beautiful UI/UX over feature complexity in productivity tools.

## What We Will Build

### Core Features
- **Task Management**: Add, complete, delete tasks with instant visual feedback
- **Persistent Storage**: Browser localStorage for data persistence across sessions
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Intuitive task prioritization through dragging
- **Beautiful Animations**: Smooth micro-interactions for all user actions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Task Counter**: Real-time display of active/completed task counts
- **Empty State**: Encouraging UI when no tasks exist

### Technical Requirements
- Single-page application (SPA)
- Modern CSS with animations and transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design
- 60fps performance target
- Sub-2 second initial load time
- Progressive enhancement approach

## What We Will NOT Build

### Excluded Features
- Multi-user functionality or user accounts/authentication
- Backend server or database (localStorage only)
- Task categories, tags, or labels
- Due dates, reminders, or notifications
- Task priority levels or sorting beyond manual reordering
- Subtasks or nested task hierarchies
- Task search or filtering capabilities
- Collaboration features or task sharing
- Native mobile apps
- Export/import functionality
- Recurring tasks or task templates
- Time tracking or productivity analytics
- Offline sync capabilities
- Theme switching (dark/light modes)
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts
- Task attachments or rich text editing
- Third-party integrations

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Performance Risk
**Risk**: Complex animations causing lag on lower-end devices  
**Mitigation**: Use only CSS transforms/opacity, implement performance monitoring, support prefers-reduced-motion

### Browser Compatibility
**Risk**: Modern CSS features not working consistently  
**Mitigation**: Target Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+; use progressive enhancement with fallbacks

### Data Persistence
**Risk**: localStorage limitations causing data loss  
**Mitigation**: Implement export warning, keep data minimal, add clear messaging about persistence

### Scope Creep
**Risk**: "Cutting-edge" label attracting feature requests  
**Mitigation**: Fixed 2-week timeline, documented exclusions, feature freeze after requirements

### Accessibility
**Risk**: Visual focus compromising accessibility  
**Mitigation**: Semantic HTML, screen reader testing, proper focus management in all features

## Success Metrics
- Task creation time < 2 seconds
- Zero data loss incidents
- 60fps animation performance
- Works on 90% of modern browsers
- Passes WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- User can complete core workflows via keyboard only
